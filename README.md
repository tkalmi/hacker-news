# (Yet Another) Hacker News Client

<a href="https://hackernews-client.netlify.com">Live Demo</a>

This is a generic Hacker News client, utilizing the open source
<a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">Hacker News Firebase API</a>.
Motivation for building this project was boredom and desire to play with React
after working with AngularJS at work for the past 9 months.

Built with accessibility in mind using mobile-first design principles. Data is
updated in real-time.

# Tech Stack

- React 16.12 (only hooks and function components, no class components used!)
- Firebase
- Redux (although used only for connecting Firebase)
- styled-components ðŸ’…
- Jest
- normalize.css

# TODO

- Better color scheme
- Improved user page
- Darkmode
- Improve test coverage
- Update publish time in real-time
- Visual cue for updated data

# Create-React-App Generated Contents

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br /> You will also see any lint errors
in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br /> See the section
about
[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br /> It correctly bundles
React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br /> Your app is
ready to be deployed!

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can
`eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from
your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive
dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have
full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but
they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point
youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for
small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this
feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t
customize it when you are ready for it.
